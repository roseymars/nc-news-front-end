# NEWS OF THE NORTH (NC NEWS) #

## Welcome to the Front-end part to my NC News Full Stack project ##

This project integrates with my [Back-end API](https://github.com/roseymars/NC-News), which I have used in order to render all of the data onto my project.

When you visit the site, by default you are not logged in. In order to log in, you can click the log in button located on the top right corner of the site and choose from the list of users. For simplicity sake, no credentials are needed and you can switch user as many times as you like. 

**After selecting a user, you will be able to:**

• Post comments on an article  
• Delete your own comments left on an article
• Like an article that is not your own

**Other actions you can do, which aren't dependant on being logged in include:**

• Using the sort by to filter by likes, author and date posted  
• Using the order by to filter by ascending and descending  
• View a list of articles by topic - choose between 'Coding', 'Football' and 'Cooking'  
• View an individual article, along with all of the comments below  

There is a floating arrow feature which you can click on and it'll take you back to the top of the page.
